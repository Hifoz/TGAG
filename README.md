#### About the game:
*The Grass is Always Greener* is an exploration game with a procedurally generated world, where the world gets more corrupted the further you move. The player's goal is to make their way through the corruption and to the end of the world.  

As you move further out into the world, you will notice the world starting to become less natural. 
You play as an animal, and can take over any animal that you meet in the world to take over their abilities. This will come in handy as not all animals can traverse every area in the world. For example: if you find yourself unable to fly over something, it might be because strong winds are pushing you back. 
The wind always blows towards where you started, so if you have lost your direction you can use it to figure out what way you need to go!
